    <h1>Antifraud System 🚫💳</h1>

    <h2>Description ℹ️</h2>
    <p>This project is about creating an antifraud system, implemented through a CRUD using Node.js for the MSC architecture. The system uses a MySQL relational database to store transactions, querying and inserting data into the 'transactions' table.</p>

    <h2>Database 🛢️</h2>
    <p>For the project's conception, it was necessary to create a database called DB_TRANSACTIONS. Database requests were made through the 'transactions' table.</p>

    <h2>Endpoints 🛣️</h2>
    <p>It's important to note that all requests were made through the '/transactions' route. To check all case validations, access the following endpoints:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GET /transactions</li>
        <li>POST /transactions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools 🧰</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Node.js with Express.js</li>
        <li>MySQL</li>
        <li>REST API CRUD</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installation of Dependencies ⚙️</h2>
    <p>Clone this project and install all dependencies:</p>
    <code>npm install</code>
    <p>Create a .env file with the following structure:</p>
    <pre>
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=senha_mysql
MYSQL_DATABASE=transactions
MYSQL_HOST='127.0.0.1'
    </pre>

    <p>After downloading the project, access the path and enter the folder:</p>
    <code>src</code>
    <p>Upon entering the folder, execute the following command to create the database tables and perform validations:</p>
    <code>npx nodemon app.js</code>

    <p>For database integration, execute this SQL script using your preferred framework that runs MYSQL12:</p>
    <pre>
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS DB_TRANSACTIONS;

USE DB_TRANSACTIONS;

CREATE TABLE `transactions` 
(
    `transaction_id` INT,
    `merchant_id` INT,
    `user_id` INT,
    `card_number` VARCHAR(512),
    `transaction_date` DATETIME,
    `transaction_amount` DOUBLE,
    `device_id` INT,
    `has_cbk` BOOLEAN
);

INSERT INTO `transactions` (`transaction_id`, `merchant_id`, `user_id`, `card_number`, `transaction_date`, `transaction_amount`, `device_id`, `has_cbk`) VALUES
    ('21320398', '29744', '97051', '434505******9116', '2019-12-01T23:16:32.812632', '374.56', '285475', FALSE);
    </pre>
